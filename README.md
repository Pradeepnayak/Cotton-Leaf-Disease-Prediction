# Cotton Leaf Disease Prediction
An implementation of a cotton leaf disease prediction machine learning model in TensorFlow. The application operates via a web interface where user can upload an image of a cotton plant or leaf and get the prediction of whether or not it is infected.

This Deep Learning Web Application is build using Tensorflow-Keras in this we have used Transfer Learning in which we are using RESNET152V2 Architecture, this web application classify images of the diseased cotton leaf,fresh cotton leaf,diseased cotton plant and fresh cotton plant.During creating a perfect model i trained this Cotton Leaf Image Dataset with Different Transfer Learning Architectures. model performs fairly good over 20 epochs with an Validation Accuracy of 0.99 on a batch size of 32.This provides a handy tool to utilize the power of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Image Classification Problems where time and accuracy is the paramount objective of classification.
